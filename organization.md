This is a structured layout of the current project.
# Objects
## `List`
The container where `ListItem`s are stored.<br/><br/>
Attributes:
- `persistence` - enum, described behavior after completion: persists, gets archived, or gets deleted.
- `display_name` - The user-defined name for display.
- `items` - list of `ListItem`s that are on this list.

Methods:
- `add` - add a `ListItem` (required param: item, the `ListItem` to be added)
- `remove` - remove a `ListItem` (required param: item, the `ListItem` to be removed)
- `change_name` - changes the value of `display_name` to name (required param: name, a `str`)

## `ListItem` & Subclasses
For use with single items. General superclass implementing common functions, most actual items should be one of the below-listed subclasses in practice.<br/><br/>
Attributes:
- `completion_status` - enum: "Completed", "Incomplete", "Partially Complete", "In Progress", "On the backburner", "Abandoned". Should have designated setter method.
- `is_time_sensitive` - boolean, self-explanatory.
- `recurrence` - enum: "none", "daily", "weekly", "monthly", "yearly"
- `recurrence_interval` - int, number of units (as defined in `recurrance`) in between occurrences of a recurring item. Default is -1 for non-recurring items.
- `scheduled_datetime` - int denoting the time in "seconds since the epoch" in accordance with the python standard library's `time` module.
- comparison operators: `__gt__`, `__lt__`, `__ge__`, `__le__`, `__eq__`, `__ne__` - implemented here for comparisons across all classes of `ListItem`s, compares two items by their `scheduled_datetime` according to the specific operator.

### `SingleItem` extends `ListItem`
Used for an item that appears once with no recurrence. Functionally, most items on a list should be represented internally by this class, but many will be generated by an `ItemGenerator` on the user end.

Sets `recurrence` to "none" & `recurrence_interval` to -1 on creation.

User use case: "change a light bulb".

### `RecurringItem` extends `ListItem`

### `ItemGenerator` extends `ListItem`
Used for when a user wants to generate 

## `Project`
- Multiply inherits from both `List` & `ListItem`, because it both stores other `ListItem`s & is itself a `ListItem` to be stored on a `List`.
