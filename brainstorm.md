### Core Tech
- List items should be able to be checked off, be able to be repeated, be able to be assigned to a specific day or time, persist even when checked off, be able to be sorted & filtered
- There should be a Project object that is itself a list item but also can contain zero or more other list items (but not other projects I think?)
- The app should keep track of, or at least quickly be able to calculate, your completion stats & display that on a certain page.
### Definite Future Tech
- Store data in portable JSON file.
### Possible Future Tech
- Interact with phone/computer calendar.
