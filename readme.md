# List & Notes Project
___
## Background
This is a project I've had floating around in my head for a while now. It's something that I need to help organize my life, but that I can't find any incarnation of that quite suits my needs, so I've decided that my first personal project after getting back into coding should be this.
## What It Is
At its core, it's a to-do list app that allows yo to add, remove, check off, sort, filter, organize, etc. all the tasks that the user wants to do.
## Project Organization
### Textfiles
- `readme.md` - This file, which contains an overview of the project, current progress & future goals.
- `brainstorm.md` - All the raw notes that I've committed to writing down but that haven't yet been sorted into a more organized workflow.
- `organization.md` - A more organized list of things to be implemented into the project. Will probably remove things from here in the future once they are properly coded & documented. 

### Python Modules
- `listitem.py` - defines our `ListItem` class & subclasses.
